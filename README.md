## About the Challenge

The 30 Days Of JavaScript Challenge is a challenge created by [Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript). The challenge is designed to help participants improve their JavaScript skills by completing a series of 30 daily coding exercises. Each day focuses on a different topic or concept in JavaScript, such as loops, arrays, objects, functions, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the 30 Days Of JavaScript Challenge. Each day's solution is contained in its own file within the `day-x` directory, where `x` is the day number. I'll not do very basic questions, like identifying data types or learning how to use external scripts, so solutions to some of the days might be missing.

Each day's solution file contains the JavaScript code I wrote to complete the exercise, as well as any additional notes or comments I have about the exercise. In some cases, I may have also included additional files or resources used to complete the exercise.

To view my solutions, simply navigate to the appropriate day's directory and open the corresponding solution file in a text editor or code editor.
